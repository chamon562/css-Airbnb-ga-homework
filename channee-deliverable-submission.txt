I was confused as to how to center text inside of an image, however doing a lot of google search and YouTubing, I managed to have something some what similar. Even though I feel like I don't get a lot of this stuff, but I can I see myself catching on to how to play around with tools in order to make it work. I learned to understand <div> a better in that it was needed as the parent in order to text-align: center or to be able to pull from it. Its the second day and I know I've been quiet. With all this foreign information flying at me, I think it's best to watch the process unfold rather than try to make sense of most of things I don't understand. I can see that applying and practicing what is needed is causing muscle memory and mental memory to recall how to navigate or how to locate the answer. To be honest I felt like giving up, but I can't. I got too much people counting on me. I respect the process. Must Respect process.
